In a silvery kitchen in a London basement, two guys are bonding over a shared love of Elton John in a blokey way: competitively trading facts about their favourite songs. But all I’m thinking about is velouté.

We’ve been on the Bordeaux for a while now – and from this basement, you can’t tell if it’s still morning. The wine makes all the metal surfaces in this professional teaching kitchen even sparklier. I don’t want my bechamel to catch, so I don’t start banging on about the timeless beauty of [Mona Lisas and Mad Hatters](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zAKIOlZrLzw). I’m standing at my hob, absorbed in the cosmos of this swirling creamy sauce. Our teacher tells us to grate some nutmeg with a microplane. Under my breath, I whisper, “*Oui, chef*.”

By now, it will not surprise you to learn I’m a big fan of the nerdy side of cookery. Learning and experimenting with new ingredients, new recipes, new cuisines, new techniques, new toys – all bring me joy. More than this, cooking is a way for me to balance a desire for socialising with a need for solitude. Alone is where I grow best, much like a soufflé needing the uninterrupted dark warmth of an oven to rise. But I also savour the experience of sharing food with loved ones. Meals are a means to nurture relationships – filling my metaphorical heart with joy, as much as they fill my literal belly. 

Food and cooking are also deeply entwined with nature and travel. My gratitude journal is stuffed with culinary expeditions, nearby and far flung, tasting as many new and delicious morsels as I can shove in my face. This theme is also bounded by time as much as place. Through spending time among nature, I am trying to intentionally cultivate an appreciation for the seasonality of ingredients: the simple but increasingly obscured realisation that not everything can be available on demand all the time.
