# How I am because you are

Gratitude is an emotion about other people.

You can’t be grateful for a cup of coffee, according to some thinkers, but you can be grateful to all the people – from barista to bean-picker – who together brought you that flat white.

It’s well worth watching A.J. Jacobs talk about his attempt to thank everyone involved in making his morning brew:

We are grateful *for* people; we are grateful *to* people.

Over the last year, I’ve been grateful to (and for) {stats.num_people} different people.

I’d felt grateful towards roughly 30 people each month, on average – until October when my people-directed gratitude entries shot up. That was the month I became more intentional about capturing gratitude towards other people – a decision that has deepened the pleasure and benefits I get from this practice.

My partner is the person I feel grateful towards most often, with one-and-a-half times the entries of the next most-mentioned person. (I shall not be mentioning any names here.)

I tend to experience gratitude for people I get to spend time with in three dimensions. The top spots belong to those I spend the most time with: my partner, close friends, friends at work, and my cats.

<Aside>My cats are people too.</Aside>

I’m grateful towards my friends in two-fifths ({stats.prop_friends} percent) of the journal entries that mention people. Friends at work and other close colleagues appear in {stats.prop_work} percent of entries about people.

Even better than squirrelling away such gratitudes is expressing them to the people involved. Tell someone how and why you’re grateful for something they did. It’ll make even the grumpiest person feel good (even though they may pretend to find ways to be grumpy about it, as a dear friend of mine did). Your act of sharing might even make it into their gratitude journal.

Meaningful connection is what makes us happiest over the long run. For nearly 90 years, the [Harvard Study of Adult Development](https://www.adultdevelopmentstudy.org/) has investigated what shapes people’s health and wellbeing – and what makes us flourish.

Since starting in 1938, researchers on this project have followed the lives of thousands of people across two generations living in Boston and Cambridge, Massachusetts (including former Harvard student President John F. Kennedy). A long, healthy life – according to their findings – isn’t down to genes, or diet, or exercise, or a high-flying career. Your cholesterol levels at age 50 don’t predict your wellbeing at 80\. The key is our relationships and how satisfied we feel with them.

Study directors Robert Waldinger and Marc Schultz [have said](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2023/01/harvard-happiness-study-relationships/672753/), “Good relationships lead to health and happiness. The trick is that those relationships must be nurtured.”

<Aside>Interestingly, the study’s directors also say that the self-reflection needed for the questionnaires and interviews are helpful for some participants.</Aside>

Gratitude is a wonderful way of nurturing not only yourself, but also your relationships.
