# What is a person?

When I talk about people, I don’t just mean fellow humans.

I consider my cats to be little furry people. They desire affection and comfort and safety. Each has a distinct personality; they are different, individual people. They communicate their needs to me (sometimes by pouncing on me at 4am and purring in my face until I get out of bed to feed them; cat-people are not always adorable).

They seem to have awareness and make decisions, much like commuters and politicians don’t.

The concept of personhood doesn’t exist in the universe independently from us. It’s not a [natural category](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/natural-kinds/). We collectively define and decide the bounds of personhood – and the term is more fluid that we might realise.

An Argentinian court [granted the status](https://bigthink.com/culture-religion/non-human-person) of ‘non-human person’ to an orangutan called Sandra in 2015\. She was born in Germany then moved to Buenos Aires Zoo for 25 years before joining other orangs and chimpanzees at the Center for Great Apes in Florida – by all accounts a beautiful retirement home of sorts for apes

In New York, two chimpanzees, Leo and Hercules, were briefly given legal personhood in a case about wrongful imprisonment. Supreme Court justice Barbara Jaffe originally granted a “writ of habeas corpus,” meaning an imprisoned individual must be delivered to the court and reasons given for their detention. The [Nonhuman Rights Project argued](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/apr/21/chimpanzees-granted-legal-persons-status-unlawful-imprisonment) this meant the chimps were seen as legal persons, although the day after her original order, Jaffe removed this wording.

The Minister of the Environment and Forests in India [declared](https://io9.gizmodo.com/no-india-did-not-just-grant-dolphins-the-status-of-hum-1149482273) that “dolphins should be seen as ‘non-human persons’ and as such should have their own specific rights.”

Even [some rivers](https://www.penguin.co.uk/books/455147/is-a-river-alive-by-macfarlane-robert/9780241624814) are [considered people](https://theconversation.com/three-rivers-are-now-legally-people-but-thats-just-the-start-of-looking-after-them-74983). The Whanganui River in New Zealand is now legally recognised as a living entity after the local Māori tribe fought and negotiated for 140 years over the waterway’s importance and sacredness. In India, the Ganges and Yamuna rivers were also granted the same rights as a person to bolster efforts at reducing pollution.

And now robots are getting in on the act. In 2017, Saudi Arabia [granted citizenship](https://www.businessinsider.com/sophia-robot-citizenship-in-saudi-arabia-the-first-of-its-kind-2017-10?r=US&IR=T) to Sophia, a humanoid android who, incidentally, once said she would destroy humans.
