# What I found when I went outside

People really, really want to be happier. Researchers have published tens of thousands of experiments over the last 30-plus years looking at what we can do to boost our happiness. Bookshelves overflow with disquisitions on discontent. If the market for self-help books was a country, it would rank among the top 100 largest economies in the world – that’s how much we spend on striving to be happier (and that’s just the books).

Entire careers are founded on the idea that feeling grateful – or doing other bliss-boosting activities – makes us feel better.

But Dunigan Folk and Elizabeth Dunn noticed a problem. The [two](https://heinelab.psych.ubc.ca/dunigan-folk/) [psychologists](https://dunn.psych.ubc.ca/) from the University of British Columbia, Canada, were reviewing the evidence for interventions that can make us happier: those tens of thousands of studies. But most of them weren’t great. The social sciences have a long history of publishing findings that might just be flukes – one-offs that other scientists [can’t replicate](https://www.nature.com/articles/533452a) when they try to run an experiment again, meaning we don’t know which results to trust.

Marking these studies against a set of criteria for high-quality research, Folk and Dunn [winnowed the massive pile](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-psych-022423-030818) down to 48 studies. And only two looked at gratitude.

The good news: both of these high-quality studies showed that gratitude has a measurably positive effect on happiness, life satisfaction, and feeling good.

But that’s decades of research, dozens of talks, countless books, advice, and common wisdom that I no longer knew whether to trust. As a researcher myself, my evidence-based faith had been knocked.

On top of that, motivational podcaster [Mel Robbins](https://www.melrobbins.com/about-mel) told me I was [doing gratitude wrong](https://open.spotify.com/episode/5euE6Z2mu25lu4guwznNRq?si=aa17f3b1fd7148b4). I was incorrectly grateful.

Robbins argues for a ‘science-backed gratitude practice’ where you should:

1. **Be specific:** Rather than being grateful for “a tasty breakfast with \[my friend\]”, I’m instead grateful for “a delicious, slow Japanese breakfast of grilled mackerel, pickles, an [onsen egg](https://www.seriouseats.com/onsen-tamago-japanese-soft-cooked-egg-recipe) and a pot of [hojicha](https://senbirdtea.com/blogs/green-tea/10-different-types-of-japanese-tea) at [Koya Soho](https://www.koya.co.uk/restaurant/soho) with \[my friend\] on a beautifully sunny October morning.”  
2. **Be personal:** try to understand why something is moving you.  
3. **Capture the experiences that linger:** if you remember it – and feel it – beyond the moment, into the next hour or next day, then that’s a signal you really do feel grateful.

(She doesn’t cite her sources so I couldn’t independently verify her claims; she seems genuine and thoughtful, though.)

<Aside>Mel is either marvellous or very good at search engine optimisation; I couldn’t find a single not-marvellous thing about her. On the **internet** of all places.</Aside>

So I tweaked how I capture my gratitudes. I now write longer, more specific entries that are grounded in time and place and the senses, and focus on the people involved. I write my journal entries first thing in the morning, reflecting on what has lingered from the last 24 hours. But I’m still not great at expressing why an experience was meaningful and moved me – and that’s exactly why I’ve written this story.
