# How I must go alone sometimes

Roman emperor-philosopher Marcus Aurelius [once wrote](https://classics.mit.edu/Antoninus/meditations.4.four.html): “Nowhere can man find a quieter or more untroubled retreat than in his own soul.” Absolute bollocks. My own soul, at least, is neither quiet nor untroubled. And yet, I enjoy retreating into it.

For me, solitude—that is, choosing to be alone; enforced disconnection and loneliness is one of the most horrible feelings for inherently social creatures like humans—is vital. Vital for feeling like I’ve stepped outside the tyranny of the clock and beyond society’s demands to be productive; for cultivating space to learn and create; for turning rumination into reflection and percolating the onslaught of thoughts; for sanctuary.

Solitude is a tricky thing to write about. I can’t regale you with any interesting stories about napping. Psychologist Susan Cain has already written the [definitive book about being quiet](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8520610-quiet); to add anything more would just create noise. So I’ll keep this section short.

I took some time off work to sit in joyous solitude and write this story. It was great. Then I went outside again.
