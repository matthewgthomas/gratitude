# How to be grateful

Just write down what and who you’re grateful for. Anywhere. You don’t need a fancy journal. Jot them on the back of a receipt or an envelope. Put them on little colourful stickies. Keep notes on your phone. You could share them, if you want (maybe even publicly, like doctor and podcaster [Rangan Chatterjee](https://www.instagram.com/p/DAtHKoMsckO/)).

That said, if you want a little more structure, we can learn from decades of social science studies of gratitude. Researchers tend to use two kinds of approaches for studying gratitude: keeping a gratitude list and writing letters of gratitude.

## Counting your blessings

List the things you feel grateful for. Typically, you’ll write three to five entries on a piece of paper, in a journal, on [stickies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-it_note), on your phone, in a Google/Word doc – anywhere that suits how you like to write. A typical prompt (from one of the [original gratitude studies](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/pdfs/GratitudePDFs/6Emmons-BlessingsBurdens.pdf)) would be to write down “five things in your life that you are grateful or thankful for”

The frequency can vary: maybe once a day, maybe once a week. In psychology experiments, it would be time-bound – going on for a few weeks or perhaps a few months. But I found the greatest benefits came much later, so stick with it.

## Expressing your gratitude

Write a letter expressing your gratitude to somebody. In some cases, psychology experiments ask participants to then personally deliver the letter. This can take a few different forms: it could be a handwritten and hand-delivered letter, a text message sent to the object of your gratitude, or a message shared publicly on social media. This might seem scary or cringey but I promise the recipient will love it.
