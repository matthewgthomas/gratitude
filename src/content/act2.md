# What the dark found in me

I [found a brilliant therapist](https://www.counselling-directory.org.uk/) and went on a long holiday (not with the therapist). Back at work, a tentative accord had been struck between my mental health and this crisis-stricken world.

But then another friend died tragically and unexpectedly. Work announced budget cuts and redundancies. And the world was still a dumpster fire. More crises – but this time, ones where I could do nothing to help.

On a departmental away day, I escaped every room I found myself in. I hid in my hotel room as much as I could get away with. I found a quiet place to breakfast alone. Uncharacteristically trembling before a presentation, I had to run outside just to breathe.

Earlier that day, my boss had called me a “beacon of positivity” – a wonderful compliment, but she surely couldn’t have meant the me standing there: this person trying to mask the anxious sweat, palpitating, with a laugh so hollow a family of squirrels could stash their winter nuts in it. She was talking to a me who no longer seemed like me.

Then, soon before Christmas, my boss sent me [a hilarious talk](https://www.ted.com/talks/shawn_achor_the_happy_secret_to_better_work) by happiness researcher [Shawn Achor](https://www.shawnachor.com/). It ended with a challenge: every day, for three weeks, write down three things you felt grateful for in the past 24 hours.

<div style="max-width:1024px"><div style="position:relative;height:0;padding-bottom:56.25%;margin-bottom:1.5rem;"><iframe src="https://embed.ted.com/talks/shawn_achor_the_happy_secret_to_better_work?subtitle=en" width="1024px" height="576px" title="The happy secret to better work" style="position:absolute;left:0;top:0;width:100%;height:100%"  frameborder="0" scrolling="no" allowfullscreen></iframe></div></div>

I finished the three weeks then just kept going. It’s now been a year. I’d like to tell you about it.

This is a story about my experiences and feelings and what I’ve learnt – told through memoir and a statistical analysis of my gratitude journal. (I am, [according to BuzzFeed](https://www.buzzfeed.com/izzywaters/are-you-a-nerd-geek-or-dork-367sa), a nerd.)

But this is not just a story about me. It’s also a story about thousands of other people who appear in psychology studies, philosophical wranglings, anthropological adventures, and centuries’ worth of books.

This is a story about choosing to pay attention and being intentional – told as a Choose Your Own Adventure. The buttons at the end of each section let you explore the story in (almost) any order you desire. You’ll encounter many segues and meanders as you go. Tap the purple asterisks like the one below to read my little asides.

<Aside>I love the writings of people like Terry Pratchett and David Foster Wallaces who make ample (and excellent) use of footnotes, endnotes, and other asides.</Aside>

This is a story about learning to let the light back in.
