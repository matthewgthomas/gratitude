## One last bit of gratitude

This is a story about seeking gratitude, paying attention and being intentional. I paid deep attention to many sources of inspiration and intentionally nicked the good bits – and feel deep gratitude to many artists, writers, scientists, programmers, and others whose work helped me write this. 

The main storyline is a mix of memoir, statistical analysis, and pop science – all [structured into five acts](https://www.johnyorkestory.com/five-act-structure/). John Yorke’s [Into the Woods](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/into-the-woods-how-stories-work-and-why-we-tell-them-john-yorke/2517983?ean=9780141978109) is far and away the best book I’ve read on dramatic structure; his website also publishes [helpful articles](https://www.johnyorkestory.com/2018/12/how-to-master-five-act-structure/). The interactive bits were inspired by childhood memories of Choose Your Own Adventure books and classic [text-based adventure games](https://lifehacker.com/10-of-the-best-text-based-adventure-games-you-never-kne-1848770935), as well as the amazing interactive essays and explainers published by [The Pudding](https://pudding.cool/), [Nicky Case](https://ncase.me/) (especially their [adventures with anxiety](https://ncase.me/anxiety/)) and the community of artists, coders and educators on [explorabl.es](http://explorabl.es).

I built a bespoke website for this Choose Your Own Adventure using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/), a speedy framework sitting atop the languages of web development. Special thanks to the generous people who make frameworks like this available for anybody to use, for free. And to the online communities that support others using them. I also owe a debt of gratitude to several AI chatbots for helping me write chunks of the code. (No AI was used for writing this story – all these words tumbled from my [human-person’s brain](https://matthewgthomas.co.uk/gratitude/?section=segue-what-is-a-person).)

All the code for this website and the analyses of my gratitude journal is [available on GitHub](https://github.com/matthewgthomas/gratitude/), under an [open, ‘no rights reserved’ licence](https://creativecommons.org/public-domain/cc0/). Feel free to reuse and remix any of it, including the text of this story.

When people part ways in South Africa, you’d say to the one leaving: “Go well.” And they would reply: “Stay well.” Whether you are going or staying, I hope you do it well.
