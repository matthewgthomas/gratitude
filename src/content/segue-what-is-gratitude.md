# What is gratitude?

Gratitude is “[a warm sense](https://www.oed.com/dictionary/gratitude_n?tab=meaning_and_use#2717721) of appreciation of kindness received, involving a feeling of goodwill towards the benefactor and a desire to do something in return.” It’s “[the quality or feeling](https://www.dictionary.com/browse/gratitude) of being grateful or thankful” – “[a strong feeling](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/gratitude) of appreciation to someone or something for what the person has done to help you.”

The word comes from the Latin for ‘thankful’ or ‘pleasing’, which itself stems from ‘[*gwerə-*’, a Proto-Indo-European root](https://www.etymonline.com/word/*gwere-#etymonline_v_53052) meaning "to favour." Gratitude is cousins with grace, congratulate, agree, and bard (a singer of praises).

Gratitude can be thought of as “an emotion, an attitude, a moral virtue, a habit, a personality trait, or a coping response,” [according to](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/pdfs/GratitudePDFs/6Emmons-BlessingsBurdens.pdf) Robert Emmons, one of the subject’s leading researchers.

It needs an object. Gratitude must be directed beyond ourselves, perhaps to another person or a non-human person (if, like me, you’re into the idea of non-human people – I talk about that in another segue). You might feel gratitude towards rivers, mountains, animals, plants, planets, cosmoses, gods.

We shouldn’t feel gratitude for just anything or anyone. Some think that gratitude only occurs when we benefit from something we didn’t earn or didn’t deserve. If we did earn or deserve some benefit – their reasoning goes – we shouldn’t be grateful precisely *because* we earned or deserved it. Mel Robbins, an American self-help guru who you’ll meet later in the story, would agree with this.

Philosophers have argued about the ins and outs of gratitude for centuries: when we owe gratitude; our obligation to be grateful (or not); the virtue of gratitude; gratitude as a thought, a feeling, a communication, a behaviour. The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy has [an epic account](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/gratitude/) of these philosophical arguments. If you like rabbit holes but don’t want to read 14,000 words of philosophical wrangling, here’s a podcast version generated by [Google’s NotebookLM tool](https://notebooklm.google/):

I have mixed feelings about these definitions and how they erect and police borders around an emotion. I don’t always feel grateful towards another person – sometimes my gratitude is intentionally directed towards myself, and that’s been a key part of healing from burnout. I personally feel gratitude for things that benefit me, even when they’re things I deserve – though I do appreciate the importance of realising we’re not always and not solely responsible for what happens to us. 

Navel-gazing aside, in my experience it is a good thing to shift your perspective towards the positives in the world – through paying attention to the good in your experiences and your circumstances. Intentionally being grateful “[creates an upward spiral of wellbeing](https://www.annualreviews.org/content/journals/10.1146/annurev-psych-022423-030818#right-ref-B26)” which changes your mindset over the long term, further boosting your wellbeing.
