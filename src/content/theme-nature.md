# How awe lies outside

April 2020: our parks were closed, barricaded by obnoxious yellow DO NOT CROSS tape. So desperate was I for the touch of nature, I found a small London Plane tree by the side of a main road, took off my shoes, and stood on the sad patch of grass. An empty bus hummed past.

Squelching and splashing in green and blue spaces is [very good](https://www.who.int/europe/publications/i/item/WHO-EURO-2023-7508-47275-69347) for your mental health. I often feel a punch in my chest (in a lovely way) when I watch a tree rustle in the breeze or water licks the bank of a lake.

The word ‘awe’ doesn’t appear often in my gratitude journal – and it is deservedly rare: that makes it all the more special. But when it does, the entries always relate to nature and travel.

A short example from a trip to Madeira: “Beautiful nature, including awe-inspiring waterfalls, on our long hike.” (It’s hardly the stuff of poems or fridge magnets, granted, but that simple sentence takes me right back to the heat and humidity up that mountain, a robin screaming from a hedge, and tiny trout racing down levadas.)

I’m endeavouring to [feel awestruck](https://hub.jhu.edu/magazine/2023/winter/science-of-awe-psychedelics/) more often. Nature and travel are routes to immersion and immanence. Sunrises, summits and stars all help me perceive the vastness surrounding us (not only on this planet but in our solar system and beyond) and my tiny place among it. Even simply looking at [photos of galaxies](https://www.rmg.co.uk/whats-on/astronomy-photographer-year/exhibition) can bash me with awe.

One small way I love intentionally rooting my attention to nature is through haiku. Vastness is hard to truly comprehend, but art can help. Haiku is a snapshot of a moment in spacetime; in some ways, you don’t write the haiku: the haiku reveals itself to you.

<Aside>“Every block of stone has a statue inside it and it is the task of the sculptor to discover it.” So goes a quote attributed to Michaelangelo. Some Inuit sculptors perceive their materials to contain stories and forms waiting to be revealed by the artist. In Terry Pratchett’s Discworld, “Inspiration Particles” constantly shoot through the universe and – just occasionally – a brilliant one strikes you.</Aside>

Here’s one from a contemplative solo moment on the other side of the world:

<blockquote>  
Faces pass through clouds,<br/>  
folds of fabric, Zen gardens –<br/>  
Yet more friends I've lost.  
</blockquote>

Ed Yong, one of my favourite writers, published a [gorgeous essay](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/30/opinion/birding-spring-merlin-ebird.html) about birdwatching. But it’s really about how choosing “to devote time and energy” to nature and place can foster a “much deeper connection to the natural world.” (But, really, it’s about birds. Here’s [a gift link](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/30/opinion/birding-spring-merlin-ebird.html?unlocked_article_code=1.gU4.IV43.6d1tgmC5lSEj&smid=url-share) to the essay in case you don’t have a New York Times subscription.) 

I love the language of devotion and connection. It harks back to my main point in this meandering story: paying attention, being intentional and experiencing gratitude are intimately linked.
