# How nourishing is food

Gratitude and food go together like mac and cheese, like cheese and wine, like wine and… those texts you probably shouldn't have sent at 2am.

Ritual blessings [in many religions](https://wanderlust.com/journal/11-beautiful-ways-to-love-your-lunch/) are a pause to express gratitude—saying grace—before a meal. We have many ways to wish someone an enjoyable dining experience that are steeped in gratitude: bon appetit (French for “good appetite”); bismillah (بسم الله; Arabic for "in the name of God"); itadakimasu (いただきます; Japanese for ‘to humbly receive’). Snapping a photo of the beautiful and bountiful banquet laid before you is, [arguably](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26210508-alchemy?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=5bmjOe0aGr&rank=2), another ritual moment of gratitude.

Beyond words, [one anthropologist described](https://hraf.yale.edu/thanks-but-no-thanks-expressions-of-gratitude-in-ehraf-world-cultures/) indigenous [Meskwaki people](https://ehrafworldcultures.yale.edu/cultures/np05/summary) in North America as expressing gratitude for food through a tremendous show of slurping soup and not leaving a morsel behind. That sounds like my kind of community.

I think about food a lot. I eat it every day. And, looking through my journal, food is a major source of gratitude for me.

The foodstuff I write about most often is chicken – in many forms: roast, escalope, stew, curry, gravy and stock all get a mention. Salmon and eggs frequently appear together in my journal as well as in my belly. I’m evidently a fan of lazy tastiness: leftovers get mentioned several times, as do takeaways and other food deliveries.

Not everyone would effuse about food this much or assert such gratitude for it. Indeed, in some societies, food is one realm where gratitude is not expected or even desirable.
