# Burn after burning

The three of us drifted in and out of silence. We had less than a week to make decisions that will fundamentally affect what we could and couldn’t work on over the next few years – and none of our options looked promising. We sat there, deflated and slumped.

In the midst of this tense, sad mood, I suddenly noticed something was different. My heart was more tortoise than hare. My armpits were more Sahara than Niagra. My breathing more hawk than hummingbird.

Through burnout, I’d become all too familiar with how stress manifests in my body. This wasn’t it.

Another surprise: I felt grateful.

I felt grateful for my two colleagues on this horrible call, for having these wonderful people who want to help each other through rubbish experiences, who dropped everything to (virtually) bunker down and solve problems together.

That’s not to say I didn’t feel dreadful. What we were being asked to do deeply conflicted with what I value. But the dread didn’t transmogrify into anxiety attacks, peevishness, or stuffing three Dairy Milks into my gob. I could hold the negativity and the positivity at the same time and be ok.

Here are two stories about the sun

The clouds burned orange. As the sun peeped over the horizon, the sky became a volcano. These are the moments you remember, aflame with drama. You stare back with an equal intensity and you try so hard to hold on to the majesty of a sunrise, you don’t notice how quickly and how subtly it’s over. The day had arrived, unnoticed, extinguishing the flames.

In the Arctic Circle, the sun won’t rise for months. This is the polar night. Purples and cyans flutter about the sky; it’s a time of auroras. Warming orange light spills out of every house. Pine trees are marshmallowed with snow. Northern Norway looks like a postcard from Narnia. The sun won’t rise for months, but winter in the Arctic Circle is never truly dark.

Gratitude feels like both of these stories. I hadn’t noticed that a lightness returned to me and the worlds I inhabit. I hadn’t noticed that light was alway around, merely dimmed. I’m the polar night and I am also a sunrise over the Sahara. 

Gratitude is about choosing. I chose to notice how it’s never truly dark. I opened my aperture and let the light back in. I’m learning to be more intentional about how I spend my time, who I spend it with, and what I pay attention to. I’m learning to comprehend what I feel and put a name to it.

Gratitude alone isn’t what helped me. It was everything, together, subtly and quietly: therapy, journalling, percolating, sharing the pain with loved ones and allowing myself to be supported by them, allowing myself to feel their love, and sharing my gratitude in return. Through writing—and sharing—this story, I have come to know myself better still.

“You don’t seem like yourself.”

I agree with my friend: I am no longer my old self. But neither am I a new self. This story has helped me realise I have been cultivating a better way of being in the world. No boundary exists between light and dark – just infinite gradients of being.
