The Danish writer Peter Freuchen couldn’t catch any walruses. He was staying with an Inuit community in Greenland who hunt these tusked, blubbery pinnipeds. Once, a hunter returned from a successful expedition, thwacking down a large amount of meat for everyone to share. A famished Freuchen thanked him for his generosity and was roundly rebuked:

“Up in our country we are human\!” said the hunter. “**And since we are human we help each other. We don’t like to hear anybody say thanks for that.** What I get today you may get tomorrow. Up here we say that by gifts one makes slaves and by whips one makes dogs.”  
– from Peter Freuchen’s [Book of the Eskimos](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/1378768), quoted in [Debt: The First 5,000 Years](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/debt-the-first-5000-years-david-graeber/2823513?ean=9781612194196) by David Graeber.

<Aside>It’s worth noting that (1) many people consider the word ‘Eskimo’ to be offensive, and (2) Inuit societies did not–and do not–enslave people.</Aside>

Similar expectations of sharing and reciprocity, bereft of gratitude, are common. Damara and Nama people living in Fransfontein, a community of around 150 farming households in northwestern Namibia, have a word: *augu*.

*Augu* means you can demand that a neighbour shares something with you – and they too can do similar. It [literally means](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12110-015-9236-5#Sec1), “asked to give (*au*) and to return (*gu*).” According to [anthropologist Michael Schnegg](https://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/bitstream/handle/document/20520/ssoar-sofid-2006-methoden_und_instrumente_der_sozialwissenschaften_20062-schnegg-give_me_some_sugar.pdf?sequence=1), “At mealtimes households can expect a neighbour’s child to pass by and to confront the household with the demand: ‘*Au te re sugari\!*’ (Give me some sugar\!)” If you have enough sugar, you’re expected to share a cupful.

What’s striking about these examples is the fundamental interconnectedness – and interdependence – between the people in these communities, as well as with the places in which they live. Our food, our home, our relationships and our environments are inextricably bound together.
