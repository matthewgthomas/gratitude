# When not to say thanks

Gratitude doesn’t always let the light back in. In [some cases](https://greatergood.berkeley.edu/article/item/how_cultural_differences_shape_your_gratitude), and in [some cultures](https://hraf.yale.edu/thanks-but-no-thanks-expressions-of-gratitude-in-ehraf-world-cultures/), it can saddle you with [guilt](http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/ipp0000037), [sadness](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Acacia_Parks/publication/313114740_Disentangling_the_Effects_of_Gratitude_and_Optimism_A_Cross-Cultural_Investigation/links/597ffa48a6fdcc1a9acef154/Disentangling-the-Effects-of-Gratitude-and-Optimism-A-Cross-Cultural-Investigation.pdf), [regret](https://doi.org/10.2117/psysoc.2010.179), or [obligation](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/73q6b248). 

In [one study](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Acacia_Parks/publication/313114740_Disentangling_the_Effects_of_Gratitude_and_Optimism_A_Cross-Cultural_Investigation/links/597ffa48a6fdcc1a9acef154/Disentangling-the-Effects-of-Gratitude-and-Optimism-A-Cross-Cultural-Investigation.pdf), people living in India reported feeling guilt and sadness when expressing gratitude – alongside more positive emotions. One participant wrote, “\[The\] only thing which always pulls me down is that I could have given some gift as a token of gratitude.”

The positives and negatives of gratitude are deeply linked in our languages. The late anthropologist David Graeber wrote about this in his book [Debt: The First 5,000 Years](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/debt-10th-anniversary-edition-the-first-5-000-years-updated-and-expanded-david-graeber/5028922?ean=9781612199337). He points out that the Portuguese for ‘thank you’—*obrigado*—as with the phrase ‘much obliged’—means “I am in your debt.” In French, thanking someone—*merci*—is “begging for mercy; by saying it you are symbolically placing yourself in your benefactor’s power.”

According to Graeber, the custom of saying ‘please’ and ‘thank you’ is a middle class invention that “first began to take hold during the commercial revolution of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries” – “It is the language of bureaus, shops, and offices.” Indeed, the word ‘appreciate’ is rooted in commerce: it [derives from](https://www.etymonline.com/word/appreciate) the Latin *appretiare*, “to set a price.”

Thanking somebody can imply differences in social status, a relationship based on deference, or being dependent on them: things that some societies [seek to avoid](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/29389897-anthropology-and-the-economy-of-sharing?from_search=true&from_srp=true&qid=2nhZw1dIzk&rank=1). Alternatively, giving thanks might be a strategy to stimulate an act of sharing before it happens – as with [≠Akhoe Hai//om people](https://dobes.mpi.nl/projects/akhoe/), a society of foragers in Namibia.

<Aside>≠Akhoe Hai//om is also the name of a southern African language. The non-alphabetical characters represent different clicking sounds in the language: ≠ resembles the sound of clapping; // is a bit like the sound you’d use to encourage a horse to move.</Aside>

Sometimes words aren’t enough. In [Amish society](https://ehrafworldcultures.yale.edu/cultures/nm06/documents/001), gratitude and kindness are expressed through thoughtful behaviours instead: brushing the husband’s hat; tucking blankets around the wife.

At an extreme, one might sacrifice a living person as a way to “express gratitude to the [ancestors and deities of the cosmos](https://uk.bookshop.org/p/books/the-nature-of-money-geoffrey-ingham/2576075?ean=9780745609973).” I don’t recommend taking your gratitude practice that far.
