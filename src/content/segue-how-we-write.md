# How we write when we write about gratitude

According to the Oxford English Dictionary, gratitude appears nearly [10 times for every million written words](https://www.oed.com/dictionary/gratitude_n?tab=frequency) – making it roughly [as common as](https://www.oed.com/information/understanding-entries/frequency/) ‘penchant’ and ‘surveillance’, but less common than some of the things we might feel grateful for, like ‘dog’, ‘machine’ or ‘parish’.

Google has collected a [vast library of books](https://books.google.com/) stretching back to the year 1500\. You can [search this library](https://books.google.com/ngrams/info) to explore trends in how words or phrases have changed over the years.

Looking at occurrences of ‘gratitude’ and ‘grateful’ over time, we can see that these words were most frequently used in the late 1700s and early 1800s (peak gratitude was in 1786).

In essence this chart is showing, of all the words in all the books in each year, what percentage of them were ‘gratitude’ or ‘grateful’.

We’ve been writing more and more about gratitude in recent decades – there seems to be an inflection point in the mid-1990s, after which uses of ‘gratitude’ and ‘grateful’ shot up.

We are grateful ‘for’ more than we are grateful ‘to’ (or any other preposition/postposition):

Most of our gratitude relates to support or help:

God, doctors and professors are the objects of most of our recently written gratitude. And God received most of our historical gratitude as well:
