# Gratitude dawns

Over the last 365 days–writing every single day–I’ve accumulated {stats.total_words.toLocaleString()} words expressing gratitude.

Here’s what I wrote about most often. This chart shows the ten words I use most frequently; tap the buttons to explore nouns, adjectives and verbs.

<Aside>I learnt a whole new programming language just to draw these charts and build a website for this choose-your-own-adventure essay. Told you I was a nerd.</Aside>

Much of what I feel grateful for reflects on time and place (“day”, “morning”, “night”, “work”) or relates to food and/or socialising. I also describe a **lot** of things–mostly food–as *delicious* or *tasty* (though I have had more than one ‘delicious chat’ over the last year). I find chats, days and people to be *lovely* and/or *fun*.

The verb ‘to have’ does a lot of heavy lifting across many kinds of gratitude, from existential (“I have no chronic pain”) and nostalgic (“Having had such a great and lovely grandma”) to simple joys (“Had a proper long sleep last night”). I intentionally consider many activities as things I ‘get’ to do, rather than ‘have’ to do: “Getting to spend Christmas with my parents;” “Got to spend most of the day working on \[this\] gratitude story.”

I write about ‘home’ a lot, in a variety of ways. Sometimes as a noun–a place I feel grateful for and where I find sanctuary. Sometimes home is an [adverb](https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/511146/is-the-word-home-never-an-adverb) (“Bringing a baguette home from Paris” or “Catching the last bus home and getting to watch us pass through London streets at night”).

Until I started analysing my gratitudes in this (nerdy) way, keeping a journal felt a bit like collecting shells or stamps or records just for the sake of having a collection. I may have discovered some trinkets that twinkled in the moonlight, but the sun still wasn’t rising.

Humans are inveterate seekers of patterns and makers of meaning. We tease order out of chaos – that’s what stories are and that’s why we need them.

And that’s why we see ancestral lions among the clouds...

... and our coat hooks look like drunken, bolshy octopuses.

Across my year of journaling, I noticed a handful of themes cropping up over and again—and growing:
