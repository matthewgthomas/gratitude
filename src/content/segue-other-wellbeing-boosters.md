# How (else) to boost your wellbeing

I don’t want to give the impression that writing down gratitudes for 365 days in a row healed my burnout. Far from it. Here are some other things I’ve been doing that I’ve found – and continue to find – helpful.

All of these involve writing, but writing is not the only way to boost your wellbeing. It’s also vital for me to exercise, including breathing exercises (especially [4-7-8 breathing](https://www.bhf.org.uk/informationsupport/heart-matters-magazine/wellbeing/breathing-exercises#478)), and do hobbies that engage my brain and body and need for creativity and problem-solving in other, more physical ways (such as baking).

**One-minute review of your week:** At the end of every week, spend no more than a minute answering two questions: what gave me the most energy this week? What could have been better?

Every three months, review these one-minute reviews to look for patterns. Then, at the end of the year, review the quarterly reviews of the one-minute reviews.

**Unstructured journaling:** Just scribble in a stream of consciousness anything that’s on your mind. I find this enormously helpful for turning rumination into percolation and putting a name to how I’m feeling (physically as well as emotionally).

This is inspired by the concept of ‘morning pages’ in Julia Cameron’s immensely helpful [The Artist’s Way](https://juliacameronlive.com/the-artists-way/), albeit less intense, less regular, and less structured. I use [these pleasing notebooks](https://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B09PW4TYJS/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1). 

**Energy and mood tracker:** This story involves a statistical analysis of my gratitude journal. Statistics is all about patterns and I love seeking patterns. I also love experimenting on myself. So, I’ve started tracking my energy levels and mood. This is quite a simple way to collect data about myself: six times a day, my phone pings with a link to a Google Form that asks me to rate my current energy level (on a scale from one to five) and to select items (from a predefined list of emotions) that best describe my mood.

I got the list of emotions from a ‘feelings wheel’ I found online. There are a **lot** of feelings wheels around – here are some options:

* Mental health charity [Mind](https://www.mind.org.uk/media/12488/emotion-wheels-downloadable-resource-2022-pdf.pdf)  
* [Canadian mental health association](https://legacy.camosun.ca/covid19/documents/camhelps/9-Feelings-Wheel-Handout-2019.pdf)  
* [The Gottman Institute](https://www.pspnet.ca/assets/the-gottman-institute-the-feeling-wheel-v2.pdf)  
* Brené Brown's [87 emotions](https://brenebrown.com/resources/atlas-of-the-heart-list-of-emotions/)  
* [Atlas of Emotions](http://atlasofemotions.org/)  
* “[How are you doing?](https://pudding.cool/2022/12/emotion-wheel/) A journey of emotional awareness, where we uncover the power of naming and visualizing your feelings”

I haven’t started analysing the results yet, but I’ve already found that spending time poring over a feelings wheel has improved my ability to notice and articulate my emotions.

All of these are quite immediate-term forms of reflecting. Here are a couple of approaches that take a longer time horizon:

**Five-year journal:** This is a way of capturing deeper memories and moods. You’ll need 366 blank sides of paper. Divide each side into five sections. Each side of paper represents one day of the year (including 29th February since you’ll experience at least one leap year when you do this); in each section, write down a few sentences – one per year.

If you were starting today, for example, you would write {today_day_month} at the top of a sheet of paper, then divide it into five sections. In the top section, write the year {today_year} and then a couple of sentences about your day today. The second section would be for {today_next_year}, and so on. You can buy journals specially designed for this, but I just use a blank notebook.

**Ago/hence:** This is an exercise I created to help me think over a longer time horizon and be more intentional about who I want to become and how I want to live in the future.

The idea is that, to think five years into the future, it’s helpful to understand not only where you are now but how you came to be here over the previous ten years.

**Writing elaborate choose-your-own-adventure essays:** I’ve found researching and writing this story to be incredibly helpful for understanding myself. I talk more about this at the end of the story.
