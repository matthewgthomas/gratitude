# What I found in the dark

4am is no time to rewrite emails in your head. It’s no time to reorder a to-do list. Nor is it a time to endlessly replay that one conversation which tightened your jaw so much you could barely chew dinner – but now your half-awake brain has *aha*’d the perfect cutting rejoinder.

Shouting at a computer mouse—compromised by fingers sticky from countless sneaky–but–necessary Dairy Milk bars—was nothing short of victim blaming.

Rather than going out to play, I spent too many evenings and weekends writing scenarios about how a conflict might evolve, calculating how many people might flee their homes, mapping where people might be cold and hungry come winter – these were the ‘fun bits’ of my job, I told myself. So it wasn’t *really* work.

Darkness isn’t merely an absence of light. Darkness is sticky–when you’re surrounded by it day after day, it becomes all you can see.

You need light to dispel the dark, but you have no energy to shine when burnt out. I grieved for family and friends and strangers, grieved for a once-familiar world, ached for a way of life that still made sense and still felt safe.
